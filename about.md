### More Information

Hi, I’m Shivam Anand, an Engineering Leader at Meta, based in Seattle. I currently lead initiatives focused on applying cutting-edge ML and multimodal LLMs to enhance Meta’s Integrity Systems. My work centers on detecting complex behavior patterns, understanding bad actors, and rebuilding trust across the platform.

Before Meta, I spent 7+ years at Google, where I led the redesign of the Ads anti-spam and fraud detection system. I scaled it from the ground up to handle over a trillion events per day with sub-millisecond latency, replacing thousands of manual rules with a suite of ML models that dramatically improved precision, recall, and resource efficiency.

My background spans a wide range of ML techniques—from anomaly detection and self-supervised learning to graph modeling, distillation, and transformers. I've worked on projects that power core experiences in Gmail, Google Search, and Video Understanding.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Technology from IIT (BHU) Varanasi, and I'm passionate about building ML systems that make real-world impact at scale.
